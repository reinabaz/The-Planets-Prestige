# The Planet's Prestige Challenge - BlueTeamLab Walkthrough

## Overview

This walkthrough covers the analysis of a suspicious email in BlueTeamLab's "The Planet's Prestige Challenge." The scenario involves investigating a ransom email with attachments that contain hidden clues leading to the attacker's identity and location.

**Environment:** Ubuntu VM (recommended for safe analysis of suspicious files)

**Note:** This is a retired challenge.

## Initial Setup

1. Download the email file from the challenge
2. Extract using the provided password: `btlo`
3. Open the extracted file in a text editor (Sublime Text used in this analysis)

## Email Header Analysis

### Key Headers Identified

**Recipient Information:**
- `Delivered-To: themajoronearth@gmail.com` - Shows who received the email
  
![first one](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f42438b-ed4f-4eae-83b2-1460335c4aed)

**Email Routing:**
- Multiple `Received:` headers trace the email's path through various SMTP servers
- The first received header represents the server closest to the recipient

![closest to the recepient](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf6facb4-2472-411a-b2d1-a5e8068df3b4)

- The last received header shows the server closest to the sender

**Authentication and Security:**
- `ARC` headers (Authenticated Received Chain) provide email authentication chain

![arc headers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/354dbba7-da4e-4f7f-88cb-61bf2bcb26cd)

- `Return-Path: <billjobs@microapple.com>` - Address used for bounce-backs
- `Reply-To: negeja3921@pashter.com` - Address used when recipient clicks reply

### Suspicious Indicators

**SPF Failure:**
```
spf=fail (google.com: domain of billjobs@microapple.com does not designate 93.99.104.210 as permitted sender)
```
This indicates that microapple.com doesn't authorize IP address 93.99.104.210 to send emails on its behalf.

**Domain Mismatch:**
The Reply-To domain (`pashter.com`) differs from the From domain (`microapple.com`), which is a red flag for email spoofing.

**Email Service Identification:**
From the Received headers: `from localhost (emkei.cz [93.99.104.210])`, we can identify `emkei.cz` as the email service used by the attacker.

## Content Analysis

### Email Structure
- `Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=BOUND_600FB98E0DCEE8.49207210`
- Contains multiple parts with different content types

### Base64 Encoded Message

The email body is base64 encoded

After decoding using CyberChef:

Hi TheMajorOnEarth,

The abducted CoCanDians are with me including the President's daughter. Dont worry. They are safe in a secret location.
Send me 1 Billion CoCanDsðŸ’° in cashðŸ’¸ with a spaceshipðŸš€ and my autonomous bots will safely bring back your citizens.

I heard that CoCanDians have the best brains in the Universe. Solve the puzzle I sent as an attachment for the next steps.

I'm approximately 12.8 light minutes away from the sun and my advice for the puzzle is 

"Don't Trust Your Eyes"

LolðŸ˜„

See you Major. Waiting for the CassshhhhhðŸ’°
```

## Attachment Analysis

### File Type Identification

The attachment claims to be `PuzzleToCoCanDa.pdf`, but we need to verify using file signatures:

![2nd content type](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/725605af-dd46-4fb0-b695-8840aeed0468)

1. Decode the base64 attachment
2. Convert to hex to examine file signature (Also using CyberChef)
3. First couple of bytes: `50 4b 03 04`
4. Using Gary Kessler's File Signature Database, this identifies as a **ZIP file**

![claimed pdf real extension](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44d176f1-a8c7-47f1-8dbc-055b02a57bc8)

**Important:** Never trust file extensions alone - always verify using file signatures (magic numbers).

### ZIP File Contents

After extracting the ZIP file (remember to use a VM for safety), several files are discovered:
Make sure to check for hidden items (On windows: View â†’ Check off hidden items, On Ubuntu: Ctrl+H)

To view a file in itâ€™s hex form, Iâ€™m using ghex on ubuntu ( You can use HxD if youâ€™re using windows)

![found files](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f6c88a5-cd14-48c2-9ceb-2e55c6acbf6a)

(Also use Gary Kessler's File Signature Database to find the file type)

#### DaughtersCrown
- File signature: `FF D8 FF E0`

### Metadata Analysis

Using `exiftool` to examine file metadata:

```bash
exiftool -r /path/to/extracted/files/*
```

Key finding: **Author: Pestero Negeja** - This reveals the attacker's full name.
